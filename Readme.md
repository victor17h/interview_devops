# Interview preparation for DevOps interview

## Questions

1. What are the benefits of DevOps and how can we utilise them? (provide use cases or examples)
2. What is public cloud, Hybrid cloud and private cloud? (use cases)
3. What is Monolithic Architecture, 2 tier and Micro-services Architecture (use cases and benefits)

## Answers

1.	
	- Ease of use: One of the primary benefits is the quick and stable solution to technical errors in software management. Additionally, improves work environment with a steady and well-balanced approach of operations.
	- Flexibility: If the team is told to do something, this could be deliver within days or weeks not months. This is could be achieved by detecting and correcting problems quickly and efficiently as the flaws are repeatedly tested through automation, the team gets more time in framing new ideas.
	- Roubustness: Promotes agility and scalaility to the business which can help to stay ahead in the market 
	- Cost: Cut down management and production costs as both maintenance and new updates are brought under a broader single umbrella


2.
	- Public cloud: Is a cloud computing that's delivered via internet and shaed across organizations.
	- Hybrid cloud: is any environment that uses both public and private clouds
	- Private cloud: Is a cloud computing that is dedicated solely to your organization. 

```
Public cloud				Hybrid cloud					Private cloud

No maintenance costs			Policy-driven deployment			Dedicated,secure
High scalability and flexibility	High scalability and flexibility		Regulation compliant
Reduced complexity			Minimal security risks				Customizable
Flexible pricing			Workload diversity supports high reliability	High scalability	
Agile for innovation			Improved security				Efficient
```

3. 
	- Monolithic architecture: If all the functionalities of a project exists in a single codebase, then that application is known as monolithic application.

	- 2-Tier architecture: in DBMS is a database architecture where the presentation layer runs on a client device and data is stored on a server called the second tier. Two tier architecture provides added security to the DBMS as it is not exposed to the end-user directly. It also provides direct and faster communication.

	- Micro-srvices architecture: It is an architectural development style in which the application is made up of smaller services communicating with each other direclty using light weight protocols like HTTP. Instead of sharing a single database with other microservices, each microservice has its own database. This allows microservices to use the type of database best suited for its needs.
