2. What is public cloud, Hybrid cloud and private cloud? (use cases)
3. What is Monolith Architecture, 2 tier and Micro-services Architecture (use cases and benefits)

## Answers

1.	
	- Ease of use: If the team is told to do something, this could be deliver within days or weeks not months
	- Flexibility: If the team is told to do something, this could be deliver within days or weeks not months

High scalability and flexibility	High scalability and flexibility		Regulation compliant
Reduced complexity			Minimal security risks				Customizable
Flexible pricing			Workload diversity supports high reliability	High scalability	
Agile for innovation			Improved security				Efficient
```

3. 
	- Monolithic architecture: If all the functionalities of a project exists in a single codebase
	- 2-Tier architecture: in DBMS is a database architecture where the presentation layer runs on a client device and data is stored on a server called the second tier. Two tier architecture provides added security to the DBMS as it is not exposed to the end-user directly. It also provides direct and faster communication.
